# Neural Fieldwork Guide
This repo contains the codes needed to replicate the experiment of our paper: **Can a Neural Model Guide Fieldwork? A Case Study on Morphological Inflection** [Preprint on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14628)

**Note:** We have used neural character-level transformer described in [Wu and Cotterell, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10213). Please copy the **src** folder from [github.com/shijie-wu/neural-transducer/](https://github.com/shijie-wu/neural-transducer/)
